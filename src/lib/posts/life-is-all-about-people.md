This year has not been my most creative year, this me comparing my output this year from the same time period last year. I never want to rush what I have to say, if I have nothing to say, I keep quiet and observe. On a usual day most of my content is derved from my personal experiences, sometimes from books or things I learn elsewhere. And this year has been so hectic with work and school, I hardly find time to reflect on my experiences, to find something to share.

I will try my best to change that but I learned something today that I had to share, it unlocked that existential feeling within me and I knew i now had something to say.

The day started regular, I overslept 8 alarms, yes, 8 alarms. I left home for school to fulfil my student obligations but I want to spare you all the details and share the underlying lessons.

Your perspective of life is very different from others, you are dealing inth money problems when another person is down bad with love problems. Both experiences are valid and one is not more important than the other, in the context of life experiences.

There's this thought that lingers as I write it this, you can have 20 years of life experience in 2 years. Life always passes by for each of us, some people hold on to every frame of the movie but others put it on 2x, trying to skip to the good part. When one person sees an hour of knowledge, you see 30 minutes.

I have always been the kind of guy to look in-between the lines, even during some of the most mundane and meaningless tasks of life, I always try to develop some sort of theory to the grand idea of existense and I have uncovered a large piece of it.

## LIFE IS ALL ABOUT PEOPLE

I always knew this, somewhere at the back of my mind but I never really understood it. Never judge a person's character based on what they have told you, narratives that a thousand mouths have modified and twisted across months and years of back chatter.
You can only assess a man's character after you have been in a room and discussed with them, of course to know deeper truths you must have been in certain situations with them, deals that involve money and other sorts.

Sometimes when you're younger you think you can achieve things alone but a very good idea that Timi passed on to me is that friends are very important.

Some days they are all you have even after the world has failed you. Yes family is important but there are friends that could be considered family.

It is only when the end is near that certain ideas come into perspective, I was about to blame myself for not knowing the grand idea before but all my other past experiences gave way for this one.

I mean we all know that school isn't a school without the students and a church isnt one without the Congregation but the main idea is that life is always going to be bleak and lonely without people.

Money is nice but who do you spend it on and with? people. You have crazy memories and experiences from your past but what makes them all come to life? people.

I think I need to go out more, relate with more people, i think that's really what I like, might not be everytime but once in a while. I like days that you're so occupied you literally forget that you have a phone, you're so engulfed in reality. Maybe that was what inspired me today, relating with others and making me understand what life is all about, People.
