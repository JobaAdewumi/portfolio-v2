Sometimes you are blank, clueless, uncertain. I really don’t think you need to figure it out at once, the journey is supposed to be a slow one, mixing stuff together, trying and failing—as long as you don’t give up.

I’ve been through this feeling of importance spiral. At the beginning i believed that it was important that you seek that feeling before you do certain things. But i was wrong, just like dads get up in the morning and do the work no matter how they feel.

> It’s not about feeling important, it’s responsibility.

One of the main facets of philosophy is critical thinking and it works with the absence of emotions.

Emotions are brief feelings in brief moments.

How can you say you hate someone yesterday, hear their side of the story and say you love them the next day.

Just as we feel like we are not important, we must do what is required of us.

Emphasis on “feel,” because whatever you do is needed and required in the world.

Doesn’t matter if you get feedback from it or not, whether it gets 10 views or a million.

You must show up and do the important work.

Look at Elon Musk, shows up for Tesla event, posts a million tweets about SpaceX recent venture.

He’s getting praised for the work that the engineers did.

How do you think they feel after months of sleepless nights, the sacrifices, joy and pain.

They get no credit at all or minimal credit but “Elon the businessman” takes all the credit.

Keep in mind, Elon could’ve worked on these projects but trust me he didn’t pull the most weight.

Now this isn’t some Elon hate, not even the point of the message.

The people that would appreciate these feats the most are people that understand the sacrifice it took and respect everyone that contributed.

But that is the point, how would you know that someone half across the world is “feeling your shit?”

How many people like your work, websites, writings, arts, podcasts and other stuff that you’ll never know. And that is it, it’s not about how you feel.

If you have work to do you do the work.

So this is a wake up call, for me and for you to leave the feeling of importance and do the important work.

To see beyond what you feel at the moment and think about the possibilities of what could be, who your work could impact.
