I attended a Mental Health event last week Thursday, during Rotimi Ashley-Dejo’s speech, he discussed his story about how everything in his life was going great but he struggled with depression and he didn’t want anyone to know.

Mental illness is the kind of thing that could get you laughed on, outed or if you have a career, out of your job.

He eventually sought help and shared his story, after his retirement he was willing to dedicate the rest of his life to Mental Health Awareness.

During his speech i found myself tearing up, it felt like i could relate to him in a way, does this say something about me?

He ended his speech with telling us that we are also advocates for Mental Health Awareness after learning about it.

I am not afraid to be an advocate for what no one wants to talk about. I used to think i’ve been depressed before but “Clinical Depression” is 2 weeks of constant sadness. I might fully understand depression but i have been sad for extended periods of time and i know how it feels to not have anyone to talk to, you’re not alone.

For me, this is my form of sharing how i feel and you read it without complaints. Thank you for reading my thoughts and if you ever want to share something, feel free to message. I’m always happen to listen.

I decided to ask the speaker about something that troubles me. A lot of people have some form of anxiety but that’s not the case for me, i only have one fear and sometimes it dictates my actions. I always ask myself, “What if i don’t succeed?” He said that we usually fear what does not exist and he was right.

We suffer more in imagination than reality, as Seneca said.

I experienced a devastating event after this and i was able to resolve it that same day. The way God or in this context, the universe comes to your aid is amazing.

I want you to start December and your life with this mindset.

You’re not alone, anything you’re feeling, a million people have felt it and are feeling it the same way you are.

Do not fear anything, even death.

You’ll always be fine as long as you’re doing the right thing, you would end up where you ought to.

If there’s anything i’ve learned this second half of the year, it’s that you got to do you.

It doesn’t matter what anyone else is doing, as long as you’re focused on your craft. That’s the only thing that should occupy your mind, your craft and your craft alone.

He ended our conversation by saying, “Any decision you make in life should be from heart and mind.”

So no matter the outside chatter, you just do you.
