You reach this resolve of content, we believe that this is a sign, that the job you're working on is the right one or the person you are with is pure vibes but this is just one layer of multiple layers of purpose.

Purpose is hardly something that you know and understand out of the gate, it's multiple layers of knowledge that gets deeper and deeper the more you unravel.

I relate it to my journey a lot, especially in regard to creating content.

I have failed and reinvented the content throughout the journey of entering deeper and deeper levels of consciousness and you must do the same, never never be comfortable on the first layer of purpose.

You must have create, break and recreate your ideologies.

I walked to our Aquarium on a fateful morning and was greeted by a fish, i glanced at it lurking around the fake vegetation we have at the top of the glass tank.

I stared closer and it was belly to the side, the fish was dead. I took the fish out and gave it a proper funeral, buried in the soil of our flower garden.

Hence its death giving life a new.

## LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MY FISH

My fish believed he was special, always shoaling with the others, he never deviated from routine (he thought he had one) but it was all nature programming, eat when fed, take a dump when needed, mate when necessary.

He always thought he was different & unique. it's hard to say if all these attributes were true because we never had a late night talk about your life session, considering that fishes don't talk.

It didn't really matter if it were true or not, it helped him survive and he probably performed his duties to the best of his abilities.

I always sat down at the front of the aquarium to observe some fish brownian motion, we have two species of fish In the tank(that I do not recall the names of).

We only have one of the first specie and the second we have about 20, they started off as 5 but have multiplied over the past 2 years(i feel like a grandparent already).

During these these observations everything feels regular, the fishes move randomly, most times together.

In the aquarium they call believe they stand for something or believe that they are unique. Sad part about this is that over my two years of independent observation, I cannot uniquely identify that fish, it made no waves (pun intended), never rebelled, never deviated from regular fish activities and therefore it was never stood out.

I want you to think about it, relate it to how we humans behave.

There are people that do everything they tell them, follow the system, get a stable job, live a stable life, never deviate from the program.

That is how they go, they cannot be uniquely identified at large, only in their closely knitted circle of friends and impact reach.

If you want to be extraordinary you must do extraordinary things.

You must be different.
