I want to offload some of my random thoughts. Firstly i realized that nobody really cares about you like you think you do, but it's not even about your wellbeing, it's about your dreams.

We all have things we want to achieve, build and create, we also understand that the journey to self actualization is not straightforward. You have to do jobs you don't want to get to the jobs you want, it might not even be something you don't want but just a means to an end. The lack of concern for others really shows when you're dealing with money.

Startup or company, nobody cares about your personal "dream" hustle as long as you work on their dream hustle, but as long as they have the money and you don't there's no escape. It is now up to you to protect that dream, keep it alive, suck it up and do the work. This is necessary for the journey.

You must protect your mind, keep your dream in mind, all day, everyday. Visualize it, daydream about it like you're living that life already. People are going to come and cut you short, limit your beliefs, tell you "it can't be done," sometimes it might even be your current circumstances. 100 years ago, Iphone 6 would've been something

"theoretical," an idea that if you told people they would say that you're "out of touch with reality." Nobody might've even thought about cause it couldn't be fathomed.

Look around you, everything that has been built today came from people who had dreams, protected them and worked on them.

We are afraid, my father told me that as long as there is life, there is hope and the worst thing is death. I used to think it too but how can the worst thing be death if you wouldn't even know that you're dead? So what are we afraid of? We have all lived long enough to know that problems come and go. People are complaining about the economy but who knows if in the next 10 years people might say these were the good old days?

You must
